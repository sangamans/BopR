# BopR, A ChatBot Made With Neural Network and Deep Learning
This Chatbot, named BopR, is my contribution to a collaborative app called JukeR.
Juker allows hosts to democratize and individualize the music choices of events, venues, and friend. Song requesters can SMS their song requests to a number outputted to the Host by JukeR and this is where BopR comes to play.
BopR can hold basic conversations with song requesters while identifying song requests. Once identifying a song request, BopR then is able to manage search requests and send usable data regarding the requests made back to the app as it is connected to Spotify API.
The cleaned data being sent back to Juker from BopR includes but not limited to artist names, popularity data, album cover image data, and the number of requests in order to make the app more efficient and easy to use for the Host.
More updates will be coming as my chatbot will be implented on an SMS interface. The JukeR app will become public soon, since it is in its final stages of development!
