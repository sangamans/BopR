PLEASE NOTE:

The json files were all used to train the chatbot model
songData.py compiled song titles of data set to training the model; found from http://millionsongdataset.com/ (tracks.txt)
botEngine.py is the actual engine for the chatbot and the folders named chatbot engines are different kinds of saved models that were used to experiment with the chatbot
chatBot.py runs the bot in python while compiling a saved tensorflow model (soon to be on an SMS interface)
